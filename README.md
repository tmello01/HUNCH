# International Ace Station
International Ace Station (herein `IAS`) is a multiplayer card game originally designed for NASA as part of their **HUNCH** program. Their task for us was to create a simple poker app so that the astronauts could collaborate in their leisure time on the station. We decided to take this idea a step further and created a fully-featured multiplayer sandbox that allows the astronauts (and now you!) to play cards across a LAN.
